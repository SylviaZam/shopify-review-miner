# Shopify‑Review‑Miner 🛍️📊
> Turn 10 k + open‑ended Shopify survey responses into clustered insights and dashboards in **< 10 min**.

Built at **Unmade Consulting** to replace two days of manual tagging per brand and unlock a paid “Insights” tier.

## 💡 Why it exists
* **Zero copy‑pasting** – raw CSV ➜ BigQuery with one CLI.
* **Actionable, not academic** – Looker dashboard ties sentiment + themes to funnel friction.
* **Scales with brands** – new brand = new `.env`, same commands.
